<P>Published: 06/2024 </P>
<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>Since the turn of this millennium, there are a few significant advances in database architecture that have changed the database landscape. From these architectural advances, column-store database management systems (DBMS) have emerged. Column-store DBMSs have enabled the rapid growth in data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This article discusses highlights of three particular architectural advances and challenges that they address.</P>

<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>Data analytics applications require databases that can reach sizes in the terabyte to petabyte ranges, thus the need for speed and capacity. Today's column-store database architectures are designed to address these needs. They depart from traditional row-store database architectures. Column-store database systems employ advanced architectural techniques that leverage faster **CPUs**, large fast **cache** memory, and higher capacity disks to accelerate query execution. This article reveals some of these architectural techniques and how they evolved.</P>

<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>If you are a developer who wants to integrate network-based services into your applications, an application programming interface (API) is a frequently used solution. In this article, you will see how you can access a RESTful API database with Python.</P>

<P>Published: 01/01/2023 </P>
<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>In this article, I show you how I used a Python application programming interface (API) to migrate my music library from a SQL relational database to a NoSQL document database. Using the Python X DevAPI in the MySQL Shell application, I highlight some basics about document databases, the Python methods used, and the database tool that enables migration. Readers who should get the most out of this article are those that have some basic familiarity with the structured query language (SQL) and with the Python programming language.</P>

<P>Published: 11/01/2022 </P>
<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a widely used markup language and text file format for storing and exchanging arbitrary data. A wide variety of applications, including the Apple iTunes application, use the XML format for exchanging or storing library data. In this article, I show you how you can use Python to read and manipulate data from an iTunes XML library file.</P>

<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>For users that need to create and manage one or more databases for personal, educational, or home office use, LibreOffice offers a simple, easy to use alternative to more complex solutions such as MySQL or Maria database applications running on a LAMP stack. This article shows how to create a music database from an iTunes library using LibreOffice as an example.</P>

<P>Published: 09/01/2000 </P>
<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>Advances in packaging technologies have enabled dramatic size reductions in  portable and wireless products. While the packaging size for integrated circuits is decreasing, pin count is increasing. The resulting increase in pin and interconnect density, however, exceeds the limits of traditional printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing technologies. The emergence of microvia PCB technology provides a bridge between high-density packaging and traditional PCB technologies. The more demanding requirements of microvia technology, however, introduce new challenges for many of today’s PCB design tools. For portable and wireless product designers, these design challenges are compounded by the requirement to combine digital, analog, and RF (radio frequency) circuitry on a heterogeneous substrate. Without the right set of design tools, design iterations resulting from functional and manufacturing errors are likely to occur. This paper discusses the design and manufacturing issues that drive design tool requirements, and some of the solutions available today.</P>

<P><b>Abstract</b></P>
<P>The rapid growth in demand for wireless products is driving the need for design tools that allow designers to meet evermore challenging design constraints. Decreasing product life cycles and shrinking product size impose new challenges to RF product designers. Advances in packaging and substrate technologies that employ embedded passives components allow RF designers to achieve size targets and performance goals not previously achievable.</P>
